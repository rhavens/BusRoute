Hey Professor!

The program should connect to the database as long as the user and password are already established with privileges to modify the tables.
The program also creates a database if on is not already established.

All you need to run a test is to enter the test file name (test1.csv). I have zipped the files together in the file structure that makes sense for the program to run.
Then to run it you simply input the command 'run'

I created a 'test' command so that you can swap between test files without having to rerun the program. Just make sure to clear the tables before each test (r)!

If you need more help the command line has a built in 'help' command with documentation I added for each command.

I have also created a 'generate' function to consolidate some of the code since table generation is used in a few of the functions.
